In your teams, please select a Product Owner.

They should make a Git repository entitled GitPuns-<team_name> on GitHub.

This repo will encompass all aspects of Git that we've covered.

This includes:


	
	adding, committing, and pushing
	forking and cloning
	reverting and/or resetting commits
	a feature-branch model with MAIN, DEV, and FEATURE-<xyz> branches
	each team member should fork and clone their own version of this repo (Product Owner won't have to fork it)
	each team member must contribute at least two FEATURE-<xyz> bgit branchranches
	each branch should contain a text file with an awful pun
	pull requests for merging your FEATURE-<xyz>s to your DEV (your copy of the original repo!)
	pull request(s) for merging the PO's DEV to the PO's MAIN
	setting your group members as collaborators
	branch protection on the MAIN and DEV branches (PO's repo)
	3 approvals before a PR is accepted, one must be from the PO
	I giving you all until 1645, so that you can really nail this.
	Once you're happy, add me (savannahvaith) as a collaborator
